# tmux-windownizer

Easy tmux window creation using fuzzy finder in specific dirs. Inspired by Primeagen's (tmux-sessionizer)[https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/scripts/tmux-sessionizer], but instead of a new session it creates a new window (if already not created).

Make sure fzf is installed.

Change in the script the list of directories where the we will look for your projects.
